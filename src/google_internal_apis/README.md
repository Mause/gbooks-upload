Google Internal APIs
====================

Google has a lot of cool public APIs! But a lot of functionality is locked behind private, undocumented APIs.
This is a project to try to make them easier to consume, as many of then use a weird version of [Protobuf JSON](google_internal_apis/json_format.py) and [GRPC Protocol](google_internal_apis/ghunter.py).
